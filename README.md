> **Note:** This project runs on a free/hobby backend. Initial requests may experience a short delay (cold start). Please wait a few seconds or refresh if needed.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **CRUD System** â€” Create, update, delete, and view job applications seamlessly.
- **Authentication** â€” Secure login system (email/password; Google OAuth planned).
- **Kanban Dashboard** â€” Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for managing job stages.
- **Filtering, Sorting & Pagination** â€” Server-side operations for performance and scalability.
- **Deep Linking** â€” Syncs filter and sort state with URLs for reproducible views.
- **Error Handling & Validation** â€” Consistent and informative feedback across UI and backend.
- **Responsive Design** â€” Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## ðŸ§© Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Express API** with clearly defined routes and middleware for scalability.
- **Separation of concerns** between data handling and UI rendering.
- **Backend-driven logic** â€” filtering, sorting, and pagination handled server-side to reduce client load.
- **State synchronization** between URL parameters and frontend store for shareable views.

## ðŸ§  Future Enhancements

- ðŸ”‘ **Google Sign-In** (OAuth 2.0) integration.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Job Fit Score** â€” Uses AI to analyze job descriptions and resumes to suggest the best matches.
- ðŸ“Š **Analytics Dashboard** â€” Visual insights into job progress, response rates, and timelines.
- ðŸ’… **UI/UX Polish** â€” Improved Kanban visuals and user flow refinements.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Capable Development

This project reflects an **AI-augmented workflow** â€” not AI dependency.
AI tools like **GitHub Copilot** and **ChatGPT** were integrated to:

- Accelerate boilerplate generation and improve refactor quality.
- Debug complex TypeScript and API integration issues faster.
- Brainstorm architectural patterns and optimize component design.
- Maintain a balance between automation and active problem-solving.

ðŸ’¡ _The goal wasnâ€™t to let AI build the project, but to enhance how I think, debug, and iterate._
